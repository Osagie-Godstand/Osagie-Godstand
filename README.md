I am currently working on the MVP of my first side project, 'Ken,' a social platform.

Disclaimer: I am not following a trend; I have always wanted to do this even before I started learning to code. I am not the type to hop from one unfinished project to another, so I will make sure to complete it, no matter how difficult it gets. Also, if I work on any new personal side project while still building 'Ken,' it is probably a 'Ken' enabler.

Goals: The goal is not necessarily to be unique but to offer a seamless user experience and hopefully make the Ken social platform valuable. I aim to ensure that navigating and using the Ken social platform is super easy.

Estimates: I won't provide an estimate for the development of this application, but I hope to finish it towards the end of 2024.

Progress: Developing the web application has been challenging but great so far.

Disclaimer: The project repositories will remain private for now."
