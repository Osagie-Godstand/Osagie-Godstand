I am currently working on the MVP of my first side project, 'Ken,' a social platform.

Disclaimer: I am not following a trend; I have always wanted to do this, even before I started learning to code. I am committed to completing it, no matter how difficult it gets.

Goals: The goal is not necessarily to be unique, but to offer a seamless user experience, excluding disruptive ads, and hopefully make the Ken social platform valuable. I aim to ensure that navigating and using the Ken social platform is super easy.

Estimates: I won't provide an estimate for the development of this application, but I hope to finish it towards the end of 2024.

Business Plan: 🤐 I have a few great ideas... I may not include these ideas in the first release of the Ken social platform. My motivation for creating the Ken social platform is more personal, but generating revenue will eventually be needed to keep the Ken social platform alive.

Progress: Developing the web application has been challenging but great so far.

Final Disclaimer: The project repository will remain private.
Organization: The GitHub account for the [addIOlogic](https://github.com/addiologic) Organization, where 'Ken' resides, only has the logo repository set to public.
