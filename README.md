- For those who care 😁 I am currently working on the MVP of a side project called Ken, a social platform. One of its primary goals is to offer a seamless user experience, emphasizing ease of use along with other valuable features. I aim to ensure that navigating and using the Ken social platform is super easy. I won't provide an estimate for the development of this application, but I hope to finish it towards the end of 2024. The progress of developing the web application has been challenging  but great so far. The repository will also remain private for now.
