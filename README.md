I am currently working on the MVP of my first side project called Ken, a social platform.

I am not following a trend; I have always wanted to do this even before I started learning to code. I am not the type to hop from one unfinished project to another, so I will make sure to complete it, no matter how difficult it gets.

One of its primary goals is to offer a seamless user experience, emphasizing ease of use along with other valuable features. I aim to ensure that navigating and using the Ken social platform is super easy.

I won't provide an estimate for the development of this application, but I hope to finish it towards the end of 2024. The progress of developing the web application has been challenging but great so far.

The repository will also remain private for now.
