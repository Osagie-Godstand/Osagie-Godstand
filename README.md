I am currently working on my first personal side project, 'Ken', a long form social platform. 

Goals: I aim to ensure that navigating and using the Ken social platform is incredibly easy, among other features that I cannot reveal at this time.

Estimates: I will need to strategize and learn as I build this application. Hopefully v1 releases early 2025.

Disclaimer: The project repository will remain private for now, but the goal is to make it open source in the future.
