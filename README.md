<h1 align="center">Hi 👋🏾, Welcome to my Profile</h1>

- I am a software developer who is continuously learning and applying my knowledge to practical scenarios.
- I strongly believe in crafting your own digital tapestry 👨🏾‍💻—don't merely unravel the threads of others' creations.
- My website/blog [odmg.dev](https://odmg.dev/)
- 📫 You can reach me at **dgodstand@gmail.com**
- I am currently working on a side project called Ken...


- The progress of the Ken social platform web application will be shown through [images](https://github.com/addiologic/ken-progress.git) until it is properly tested, deployed, and ready for use. The repo will remain private for now. I'll consider making it public after I release v1 of the application.
