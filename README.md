I am currently working on the MVP of my first personal side project, 'Ken', a social platform. It will not be the typical kind of social platform like X or Reddit. It'll be a more formal social platform. 

Disclaimer: I am not following a trend; I have always wanted to do this, even before I started learning to code. I am committed to completing it, no matter how difficult it gets.

Goals: The goal is to offer a seamless user experience, excluding disruptive ads, and hopefully make the Ken social platform valuable. I aim to ensure that navigating and using the Ken social platform is super easy. 

Estimates: I won't provide an estimate for the development of this application due to work and other collaborative side projects that keeps me busy, but I hope to finish it towards the end of 2024. 

Progress: Developing the web application has been challenging but great so far. 

Final Disclaimer: The project repository will remain private for now but aims to be open source in the future.
