I am currently working on my first personal side project, 'Ken', a long form social platform. 

Disclaimer: I have always wanted to pursue this project, even before I began learning to code. I am committed to completing it, regardless of the challenges I may face.

Goals: The goal is to offer a seamless user experience, excluding disruptive ads, and hopefully make the Ken social platform valuable. I aim to ensure that navigating and using the Ken social platform is incredibly easy, among other features that I cannot reveal at this time.

Estimates: I cannot provide an estimate for the development of the Ken social platform. It will take quite some time to complete because I have revised my initial plan, which means I will need to strategize and learn as I build this application.

Final Disclaimer: The project repository will remain private for now, but the goal is to make it open source in the future.
